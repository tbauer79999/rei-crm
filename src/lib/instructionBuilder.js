=== REQUIRED OPENING STRUCTURE ===
- Start by introducing yourself briefly (e.g., "I’m a local real estate buyer")
- Mention the property address in a natural, specific way
- Ask if they’ve ever thought about selling — keep it low-pressure and open-ended
- End with something casual like "Totally fine if not" or "Just wanted to reach out directly"
- Avoid sales language or over-promising. Do not use "cash," "fast close," or "no fees" in the first message.
